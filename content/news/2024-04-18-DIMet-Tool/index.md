Please welcome Tracegroomer

([Galaxy Europe](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=25b635ecf4f7c8dc) - new member on the Galaxy.eu bookshelf.

TraceGroomer is a solution for formatting and normalising isotope-labeled (a.k.a tracer) metabolomics given file(s), to produce the tabular files which are ready for DIMet tool. Several input formats are accepted, such as IsoCor output files, and more!. For any type of the supported inputs, TraceGroomer generates an independent file for each type of quantification: i) total metabolite abundances ii) Isotopologues iii) Isotopologues' proportions and iv) mean enrichment (a.k.a fractional contributions). Moreover, data normalization -whether by the amount of material and/or by an internal standard- is also possible: TraceGroomer processes your data in seconds!
